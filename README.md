### Features:

- Calculator Button entry
- Text input + your keyboard entry
- Delimeter support for 'addition' using `+` `,` `ENTER` (a new line), and custom delimeters
- To define a custom delimeter: `//myCustomDelimeter`, then `ENTER` for a new line and then type your logic: `number myCustomDelimeter number` (using a mix of whatever delimeters you would like)
- To define multiple custom delimeters enter: `//[myCustomDelimeter1][myCustomDelimeter2]`, then `ENTER` for a new line, then type your logic: `number myCustomDelimeter1 number myCustomDelimeter2` (using a mix of whatever delimeters you would like)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the Calculator:

`npm install`
`npm run start`

localhost 3000 should automatically open if it's not in use
